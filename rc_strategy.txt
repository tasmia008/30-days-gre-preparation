1. If the passage is too long [400-500 or more words] and it appears within first 10 questions, skip it blindly. randomly guess the answers just as a placeholder, probably skim the topic while going to next question(s). Clicking on next button and refresh take some time.

2. If they appear after the first 10 questions, attempt it. If you correctly answer 50% of the questions, you will reach 150 score. 

3. Will aim to answer 18 questions out of 20 in 30 mins. 1.67 mins (1 min 40.2 seconds) / question on average. Will randomly guess 2 really hard questions.

4. Will try to answer 18 questions correctly and with full confidence. In the worst case, there will be 3 mistakes on average.

5. So, 2 missed + 3 wrong answers, 15 correct / 20. On average 30/40 -> 160 in verbal which is a great score.

6. Each time mark one with full confidence, mark it âœ“. If slightly unsure, mark it ?. You want to get at least 17 tick marks. One ? max (if answered 18). For guessing, use x [you will always guess, never directly skip. For guessing, don't spend more than 15 secs]. Do it in order, so it's easy to track unanswered / unsure answers.

7. Reading similar to driving. If simple words, simple phrases go fast. If congestion / complex words go slow, but never stop and make sure you never have to go back, don't crash either.

8. Use a pointer (pen) if possible.

9. For RC, read the question first, then read the first and last senteces soon to get an overall idea of the passage. Then start reading fast.

10. While reading, create an ongoing visualization / story on your mind. 

11. While preparing, always maintain an error log. Focus on those questions more.
